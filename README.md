now I realise actually beyond 0 this will require too much time we have to decide on the language... Gotta checkout some more versions firstr.. since everytime we get something roughly right it provokes many thoughts.. about the ultimate version. Each language has many benefits and cons... 

So a static compile is definitely preferred to produce variants. This could instead pipeline to llvm and make hte others.. 
In any case.. a namespace/module/class/funtions/consts approach is best.
