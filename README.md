### the first pause: how you normalise in each language to the same response is interesting.. in that it borks the comparison.

1. this feature is critical. We need to scan first for a pattern to avoid chaos descending into pattern hell.

i. so this means where errors of EACCESS and EPERM occur and their analogs./.. in the other solutions since i am interested. to see.. 

`res/normalisation/0/` is the current schema used to normalise these conditions.. i think.

I will probably give up normalisatoin this but is houdl be teh same thing essentially translaterd into one from the rules.. surely.... 

( this is also what we are interested in subsequently )
