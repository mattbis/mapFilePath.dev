## complex only
- `--flat` :default | `--nested`
- ~`-d` `--depth`~
- ~`--format`~ json only for now

- `--pipe` this means you cant see any error or information; it overrides below configurability. ( we only have one output to keep it simple ) 

- `--verbose`

- `-o` `--out` as well as stdout append to file ( this will only duplicate std out, minus: messages )
- ?? hmmm ive nver thought of q really before as arg... `q` stops any messages when used for direct invocation ( in the console, if its after --verbose it wont be verbose, if verbose is after it will be ) 
- `c` `--count` make a total count ( obv slow down ) ( at the end of the structure )

### map src
- etc
### chunk
- todo: 1m 8192b 1g etc
- `--chunk` `[size]` when out [[chunk]]  and with ? `-o`.
