`--user` == you `--user` somebody else as you ( since you must be logged in )
`--all` try it for everyone in tests ( in complex we could consider a `--diff` option preceeding `--report-on-wrong-user` type thing

defaults just means the values in `res` and `--profile` are some handy presets... running without a thing to do means a cli menu appears.
