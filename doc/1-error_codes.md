# error codes
1. in this mode, errors are not raw but use the static definition... which puts them in a severity vector.
- hard to class [acc,perm,term,? ] other things i have forgotton. If we did this we woudl have to reflect and unify what each language uses etc assuming try/catch// exceptions etc... since the vector is a bit tricky to order for the moment..
